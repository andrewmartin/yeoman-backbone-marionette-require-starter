# yeoman-backbone-marionette-require-starter kit
=================================

This is a temporary sample project using:

- Yeoman
- Backbone
- Bootstrap (RC3), temporarily set up as submodule so we can checkout the RC3 branch
- Backbone Marionette
- RequireJS
- RequireJS Text
- A few other goodies

This is based on the nicely done [https://github.com/rtorr/coffee-backbone-require-bootstrap](coffee-backbone-require-bootstrap) setup by rtorr. (THANKS!)

Follow the discussion here: https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/956#issuecomment-22076327

This uses SCSS, so you'll need to install that before running.

### Run:

    npm install

    bower install

    grunt server

    or for build

    grunt
